# blinkenlichten
an 8-bit binary adder in JS canvas.

## Plan 

building the front panel of an 8-bit binary adding machine like the one described early in Charles Petzold's book _Code_.
Ultimate idea is to build each of the little constructs in the book until I get an ALU. Also reading _Inside the Machine_.
